# //Set up the ADC register by sending the next bits:
# //*Represents the suggested configuration to only read from A1N0

# //int os:       Operational status/single-shot conversion start.
# //          This bit determines the operational status of the device.
# //          This bit can only be written when in power-down mode.
# //          Write status:
# //            0b0: No Effect.
# //            0b1: Begin single conversion (when in power-down mode).* 
# //          Read status
# //            0b0: Device is currently performing a conversion.
# //            0b1: Device is not currently performing a conversion.

# //int imc:      Input multiplexer configuration.
# //          These bits configure the input multiplexer.
# //          VIN (AINX minus AINY):
# //            0b000: AIN0 - AIN1
# //            0b001: AIN0 - AIN3
# //            0b010: AIN1 - AIN3
# //            0b011: AIN2 - AIN3
# //            0b100: AIN0 - GND*  
# //            0b101: AIN1 - GND
# //            0b110: AIN2 - GND
# //            0b111: AIN3 - GND

# //int pga:      Programmable gain amplifier configuration
# //          These bits configure the programmable gain amplifier. 
# //          FS:
# //            0b000: +-6.144V
# //            0b001: +-4.096V*
# //            0b010: +-2.048V
# //            0b011: +-1.024V
# //            0b100: +-0.512V
# //            0b101: +-0.256V
# //            0b110: +-0.256V
# //            0b111: +-0.256V

# //int mode:     Device operating mode
# //          This bit controls the current operational mode: 
# //            0b0: Continuous conversion mode.*
# //            0b1: Power-Down single-shot mode.

# //int rate:     Data rate
# //          These bits control the data rate setting:
# //            0b000: 128SPS
# //            0b001: 250SPS
# //            0b010: 490SPS
# //            0b011: 920SPS
# //            0b100: 1600SPS*
# //            0b101: 2400SPS
# //            0b110: 3300SPS
# //            0b111: 3300SPS

# //int comp_mode:  Comparator mode
# //          This bit controls the comparator mode of operation.
# //          It changes whether the comparator is implemented as a traditional comparator 
# //          or as a window comparator:
# //            0b0: Traditional comparator with hysteresis.*
# //            0b1: Window comparator.

# //int comp_pol:   Comparator polarity
# //          This but controls the polarity of the ALERT/RDY pin:
# //            0b0: Comparator output is active low.*
# //            0b1: ALERT/RDY pin is active high.

# //int comp_lat:   Latching comparator
# //          This bit controls whether the ALERT/RDY pin latches once asserted or clears once
# //          conversions are within the margin of the upper and lower threshold values:
# //            0b0: The comparator output is active low.*
# //            0b1: ALERT/RDY pin is active high.            

# //int comp_que:   Comparator queue and disable 
# //          These bits perform two functions:
# //            0b11: Disable the comparator function and put the ALERT/RDY pin into a high state.*
# //              Otherwise they control the number of successive conversions exceeding the upper or
# //              lower thresholds required before asserting the ALERT/RDY pin.
# //            0b00: Assert after one conversion.
# //            0b01: Assert after two conversions.
# //            0b10: Assert after four conversions.
